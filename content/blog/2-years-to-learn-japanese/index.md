I worked my ass off, I did everything I thought was right. I tried as hard as I could, and I didn't end up where I wanted to be. This is the story of my 2 year struggle with Japanese.

I just want to preface that this post is not about discouraging anyone from studying Japanese and/or a second language. I just want to dispel some myths and help people set realistic expectations for themselves.

At the time of writing this post it has been almost 3 years since I started studying Japanese and I still don't consider myself fluent. Let's start out with the definition of fluency from google -

> (of a person) able to express oneself easily and articulately.

I think the definition the fluency for everyone is different, but for myself fluency meant the above definition but also meant a lot more. It meant being able to do the the things a normal Japanese person could do. This means, watching TV, listening to radio, communicating with cashiers, understanding locals, being able to go on dates and just overall, ease of understanding and speaking Japanese.

When I first moved to Japan I lived up north in a ski town called Niseko and initially had zero desire to learn Japanese being surrounded by foreigners. After about a month or two of living there I realized how awesome Japanese sounded to me and how useful it would be to be able to speak and read Japanese. So after reading some reddit posts, looking at all the cool language apps in the play store and watching some youtube videos I said "fuck it, lets do it, how hard could this whole Japanese thing be?"

tldr: 意外に難しかった、 fucking hard.

I felt inspired after watching some polyglot videos about some slightly overweight irish fellow learning japanese in just 3 months! A lot of these so called polyglot gurus and internet senseis said you could do it in about 6 months - 1 year if you worked HARD. So I said "God damn it I'm a pretty resourceful guy and I live in Japan, if anyone can do it in 6 months to a year I can right?"
