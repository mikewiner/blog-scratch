## The beginning

I worked my ass off, I did everything I thought was right. I tried as hard as I could, and I didn't end up where I wanted to be. This is the story of my 2 year struggle with Japanese.

I just want to preface that this post is not about discouraging anyone from studying Japanese and/or a second language. I just want to dispel some myths and help people set realistic expectations for themselves.

At the time of writing this post it has been almost 3 years since I started studying Japanese and I still don't consider myself fluent. Let's start out with the definition of fluency from google -

> (of a person) able to express oneself easily and articulately.

I think the definition the fluency for everyone is different, but for myself fluency meant the above definition but also meant a lot more. It meant being able to do the the things a normal Japanese person could do. This means, watching TV, listening to radio, communicating with cashiers, understanding locals, being able to go on dates and just overall, ease of **understanding** and speaking Japanese.

When I first moved to Japan I was a Snowboarding Instructor and lived up in Hokkaido in a ski town called Niseko and initially had zero desire to learn Japanese being totally surrounded by foreigners. After about a month or two of living there I started realizing how awesome Japanese sounded to me and how useful it would be to be able to speak and read Japanese. I thought how fucking awesome would it be if I could learn what a "Spirit Bomb" was in Japanese. And every time I looked at some mysterious Japanese text it motivated me to start learning.

So after reading some reddit posts, looking at all the cool language apps in the play store and watching some youtube videos I said "fuck it, lets do it, how hard could this whole Japanese thing be?"

tldwtr: 意外に難しかった、 fucking hard.

I felt inspired after watching some polyglot videos about some slightly overweight irish fellow learning japanese in just 3 months! And reading about this so called 69-31 errr, 80-20 rule. A lot of these so called polyglot gurus and internet senseis said you could do it in about 6 months - 1 year IF you worked HARD. So I said "God damn it, I'm a pretty resourceful guy and I live in Japan, if anyone can do it in 6 months to a year I can right?"

## Stage 1 - Got Apps bro? and Pimsleur (0-3 months)

So about sometime in the middle of December I started visiting the [reddit.com/r/learnjapanese](http://reddit.com/r/learnjapanese) subreddit like it was my religion. I saw the instagram ads, the blog posts, the youtube videos, the paid advertisements.

 I decided in this digital age the best way to learn a language was with Apps, so I downloaded them all, Duolingo, Lingodeer, Memorize, Anki, some japanese dictionaries, and I started learning how to read. I also had a friend who was able to *seemingly* have decent conversation with locals from only using Pimsleur for a few months before coming to Japan.

So I started only maybe spending about ~30 mins a day studying but that quickly escalated to several hours a day. I was learning Hiragana, Katakana, then quickly moved to the Kanji. I became obsessed pretty quickly, but unfortunately I hurt my shoulder on a failed back-flip attempt (who knew that you could pop out out your shoulder and concuss yourself at the same time?) and it sort of forced me into a retirement from teaching snowboarding, which was great because now I could find a job where I study japanese and japanese culture full time!

So after about 2~3 months of using the apps and Pimsleur I was better than all my other Gaijin friends, I had finished the Duolingo tree, I was done almost all of the Lingodeer lessons, I knew a few hundred kanji but I still nowhere close to to fluent.  I couldn't understand what the store clerks were saying, I could only read the most basic of signs, I certainly could not hold a conversation unless it was about the most basic of things (weather, hello, hot cold things like that). The thing that bothered my the most was that no matter how much grammar, vocab, kanji and everything that I learnt I could understand ANYTHING that any one said back to me. That pudgy Irish polyglot had deceived me...

## Stage 2 - Genki and Anki, to infinity and beyond (3months - 1 year)

I decided that being in Japan wasn't just enough but to get myself in a truly immersive environment I would need to move to the 田舎 aka the japanese countryside. So I found myself teaching English at mountain school in the middle of nowhere Japan and for the first little while it was truly living the dream.

At this point in my Japanese journey I felt pretty good about my Japanese level, I was better than all my friends in Hokkaido and could start to read more and more. I was very much so, in relation to the dunning-kruger effect at the top of Mt. Stupid and god damn, I felt good.

![My stupid self right at that first peak.](./dunningkruger.png)

I started my long tumble from the top of Mt Stupid very shortly after moving and living with other Gaijin who were much more fluent in Japanese than myself. My first realizations that not only was I no where near fluent but Japanese was in fact horrible was about the first or second day, when my Japanese co-worker took me around to 挨拶 (aisatsu) or greet all our Japanese neighbors. It was my first time hearing that word and the first I did was announce to all my coworkers that I was going 暗殺 (ansatsu) all my neighbors. Just a small pronunciation mistake but I had just announced to all of 15 coworkers that I was going to assassinate all of my neighbors ... Not the best first impression. Also while in the midst of brutally assassinating ... I mean pleasantly greeting all neighbors, I couldn't understand anything of what was being spoken, **nothing**. I was felt a floundering child lost in the middle of the ocean.

How could this be I had used all the apps reddit had recommended, I spent the time, I was learning the kanji maybe I knew about ~500 by then. What was wrong? Surely after 3 months I should be able to understand something right!?

So I went back to the drawing board and tried to revise my study strategy to become within this 1 year mark. I called upon reddit sensei once again, and started consuming their beginner wiki like every word was the word of GOD him self. The result of my research from the holy father is as follows.

1. Thou shalt buy Genki and study grammar everyday.
2. Thou shall ONLY use Anki and forego the other sacrilegious apps (sorry duolingo and other)

## Stage 3 - JLPT N2 - the final frontier??? (1 - 1.5 years)

## Stage 4 - Okinawa - the finalest frontier!?!? (1.5 - 2 years)

## Stage 5 - 本当に最後があるのかよ!? This is taking forever.

In the end I was able to a lot of what I set up to do. I went on dates, I talked with the locals, I watched the anime, I read the manga, I learnt the Japanese for Spirit Bomb (元気玉くらえ!!!) but most importantly I learnt you can't fucking be fluent in Japanese in under 2 years. But don't let that stop you from trying!
