## The beginning

I worked my ass off, I did everything I thought was right. I tried as hard as I could, and I didn't end up where I wanted to be. This is the story of my 2 year struggle with Japanese.

I just want to preface that this post is not about discouraging anyone from studying Japanese and/or a second language. I just want to dispel some myths and help people set realistic expectations for themselves.

At the time of writing this post it has been almost 3 years since I started studying Japanese and I still don't consider myself fluent. Let's start out with the definition of fluency from google -

> (of a person) able to express oneself easily and articulately.

I think the definition the fluency for everyone is different, but for myself fluency meant the above definition but also meant a lot more. It meant being able to do the the things a normal Japanese person could do. This means, watching TV, listening to radio, communicating with cashiers, understanding locals, being able to go on dates and just overall, ease of understanding and speaking Japanese.

When I first moved to Japan I was a Snowboaring Instructor and lived up in Hokkaido in a ski town called Niseko and initially had zero desire to learn Japanese being totally surrounded by foreigners. After about a month or two of living there I started realizing how awesome Japanese sounded to me and how useful it would be to be able to speak and read Japanese. I thought how fucking awesome would it be if I could learn what a "Spirit Bomb" was in Japanese. And every time I looked at some mysterious Japanese text it motivated me to start learning.

So after reading some reddit posts, looking at all the cool language apps in the play store and watching some youtube videos I said "fuck it, lets do it, how hard could this whole Japanese thing be?"

tldwtr: 意外に難しかった、 fucking hard.

I felt inspired after watching some polyglot videos about some slightly overweight irish fellow learning japanese in just 3 months! And reading about this so called 69-31 errr, 80-20 rule. A lot of these so called polyglot gurus and internet senseis said you could do it in about 6 months - 1 year IF you worked HARD. So I said "God damn it, I'm a pretty resourceful guy and I live in Japan, if anyone can do it in 6 months to a year I can right?"

## Stage 1 - Got Apps bro? and Pimsleur

So about sometime in the middle of December I started visiting the [reddit.com/r/learnjapanese](http://reddit.com/r/learnjapanese) subreddit like it was my religion. I saw the instagram ads, the blog posts, the youtube videos, the paid advertisements.

 I decided in this digital age the best way to learn a language was with Apps, so I downloaded them all, Duolingo, Lingodeer, Memorize, Anki, some japanese dictionaries, and I started learning how to read. I also had a friend who was able to *seemingly* have decent conversation with locals from only using Pimsleur for a few months before coming to Japan.

So I started only maybe spending about ~30 mins a day studying but that quickly escalated to several hours a day. I was learning Hiragana, Katakana, then quickly moved to the Kanji. I became obsessed pretty quickly, but unfortunately I hurt my shoulder on a failed backflip attempt (who knew that you could pop out out your shoulder and concuss yourself at the same time?) and it sort of forced me into a retirement from teaching snowboarding, which was great because now I could find a job where I study japanese and japanese culture full time!

## Stage 2 - Genki and Anki, to infinity and beyond~

My next sto

## Stage 3 - JLPT - the final frontier???

## Stage 4 - Okinawa - the finalest frontier!?!?

## Stage 5 - 本当に最後があるのか!? This is taking forever.

In the end I was able to a lot of what I set up to do. I went on dates, I talked with the locals, I watched the anime, I read the manga, I learnt the Japanese for Spirit Bomb (元気玉くらえ!!!) but most importantly I learnt you can't fucking be fluent in Japanese in under 2 years. But don't let that stop you from trying!
